On part 4 I was having issues with the /favoritepeople endpoint.  I was planning on storing an array of people Ids and using the length of the array to display the count of favorites.  Since i could not get the endpoint to work I added the functionality and managed the array in the state.  So favorites will not persist, but you will atleast be able to see the functionality that I was going for.   

There were a couple of features that I thought could be added, but was not sure if you wanted them based off of the readme.
I chose to go on to additional parts rather than add features that you may not have wanted.
- The ability to go between different pages of search results.
- Ability to search by planet.
